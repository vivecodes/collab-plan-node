## 🛑 Disclaimer

This project, **Plan Together**, is a **learning exercise** designed to practice **real-time communication with Socket.IO** in a full-stack application.

🔹 **Not all possible improvements and best practices** (such as advanced security, performance optimizations, and extensive error handling) were implemented, as they were **not a priority** for this learning-focused development.

🔹 The application **is not optimized for mobile devices** and **does not include advanced UI styling or animations**. The focus was on building functional real-time features rather than aesthetics.

🔹 While the core functionality works, this project is not production-ready and should not be used for real-world applications without further refinements.

👩‍💻 Goal: Gain hands-on experience with **Next.js, Socket.IO, MongoDB, and real-time updates**.
